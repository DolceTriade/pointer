# Pointer

Pointer is a "good enough" code search system designed for teams that need useful answers quickly without the overhead of heavyweight indexers.

## Goals

- **Fast to index** – ingest entire repositories in minutes using language-agnostic parsing and batched storage updates.
- **No compiler required** – tree-sitter based extractors deliver symbols and references without building your code.
- **Easy to integrate** – a simple CLI uploader and HTTP backend make it straightforward to drop Pointer into existing workflows.

We focus on pragmatic accuracy, small operational footprints, and quick iteration so you can ship better developer tooling without waiting on perfect analysis pipelines.
